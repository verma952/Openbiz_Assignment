# --- Build Stage ---
# Step 1: Use a Node.js image to build the React app
FROM node:18-alpine as builder

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the frontend source code
COPY . .

# Step 2: Build the React app for production
# This creates a highly optimized 'build' folder with static files
RUN npm run build

# --- Production Stage ---
# Step 3: Use a lightweight web server (nginx) to serve the built files
FROM nginx:stable-alpine

# Step 4: Copy the optimized build output from the 'builder' stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 5: Expose the default nginx port
EXPOSE 80

# Step 6: The default nginx command to start the server will run automatically
